            <p>Some headers are in <span style="color: tomato;">weird locations</span>. For instance, GLEW include files are located in external/glew-x.y.z/include/. The compiler has no way to magically guess this, so you have to tell him. In the project settings, add the appropriate path in the COMPILER (not linker) options.

                Under no circumstance you should copy files in the compiler’s default directory (Program Files/Visual Studio/…). Technically, this will work, but it’s very bad practice.
                
                Also, it’s good practice to use relative paths ( ./external/glew/… instead of C:/Users/username/Downloads/… )</p>
